# My-Portfolio
This is a simple web-page that outlines projects I have worked one.

# Motivation
The project is built as the first project towards the completion of my Front-End Web Developer Nano Degree Program, provided by Udacity, sponsored by Google and supported by Andela.

# Languages Used
This project was built using the following languages
  * HTML5 - I used semantic HTML5 to give meaning to the elements of the page
  * CSS3 - I have also added some basic styling and responsiveness to the page using CSS3
  
# Disclaimer
My-Portfolio is a work in progress, and as such the featured work section currently contains placeholders and not real projects.
